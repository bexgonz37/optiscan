# Analog Engine — Build Log & Implementation Map

Authoritative design: the artifact **"The Analog Engine — Quantitative Blueprint."**
This file is the build map, cost review, blocker register, and phase resume point.
Baseline for the build: `main` @ `40e68b7` (10-phase research rebuild complete).

## Phase → codebase map (dependency order)

| Blueprint phase | New / reused code | Additive tables | Gate to advance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A · Episode schema + labels** | `lib/research/episode/{schema,labels,leakage,store}.ts` | `setup_episodes`, `episode_labels` | leakage checks pass on adversarial fixtures; label math correct on fixtures |
| **B · Evaluation harness + baselines** | `lib/research/eval/{harness,baselines,metrics}.ts` | `eval_runs`, `eval_results` | harness reports lift on synthetic-edge data, **zero** lift on synthetic-random data |
| **C · Replay seeding** | redesign `historical-replay.ts` to emit Episodes+labels; reuse `replay_runs` checkpoint | (reuse) | survivorship-free, deduped, deterministic rebuild; sane label/regime distributions |
| **D · Tier-1 analog engine** (GATE) | `lib/research/analog/{features,similarity,retrieval,distribution}.ts` | `analog_index` (optional) | out-of-sample calibrated expectancy beats ALL §9 baselines incl. broker-visible. No lift ⇒ STOP + bounded remediation |
| **E · Options mapping + card** | `lib/research/reco/{contract,card}.ts` | `recommendations` | contracts pass hard liquidity gates; modeled flag always present; card traces to evidence |
| **F · Forward paper validation** | wire reco → existing research paper lane (flag-gated) | (reuse `paper_trades`) | forward OOS lift + calibration hold across multi-month, multi-regime |
| **G · Learning loop + clustering + decay** | `lib/research/learn/{update,cluster,decay}.ts` | `patterns`, `pattern_versions`, `pattern_state` | decay catches a synthetic-decayed pattern; updates stable not jumpy |
| **H · Tier-2/3 + ablation-gated data** | embeddings/sequence; premium data only if ablation proves lift | tbd | each addition beats predecessor OOS past multiple-testing correction |
| **I · Broker automation** | — | — | **only after** sustained forward validation (blueprint: 12+ mo, ≥1 regime change) + deterministic risk caps |

**Reuse substrate:** `setup_candidates`/`setup_gate_results` (decision-time context feed), `counterfactual_outcomes` (Zone-D observations), `ai_training_rows` (training view), `paper_trades` (Zone-C execution + MFE/MAE), `model-registry.ts`/`model-evaluation.ts` (champion/challenger scaffold), `logistic-model.ts` (baseline), `data-freshness.ts` (provenance), `bearish-gate.ts`/`options-universe-policy.ts` (authoritative deterministic gates — never overridden).
**Freeze (no investment):** lanes/challenge/strategy-agents-V2/AI-proposal machinery, `setup-fingerprint`/`setup-statistics` (weak Tier-0). **Ignore:** broker/charting parity.

## Cost review (~$500/mo)

| Expense | Classification | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Polygon/Massive data plan | **essential now** | The `/v2/aggs` history IS the memory seed — the single most **underused** asset already paid for. Do **not** cancel. |
| Railway hosting (app + SQLite volume) | **essential now** | Hosts capture + the DB (historical evidence). Do not disable. |
| Scheduler jobs: AI research / learning / improvement cadence (`SCHED_AI_CHECK_MS`, `SCHED_LEARNING_MS`, `SCHED_IMPROVEMENT_MS`) | **safe to pause / scale down** | Produce no edge today; lengthening intervals trims compute. **Env-only change — documented, not performed here; destroys no data.** |
| Lanes / Challenge / agents-V2 / AI pipeline (flags) | **already OFF** | No active cost; frozen in code. |
| Historical **options** entitlement | **unjustified until ablation** (§13) | Not entitled; options outcomes are MODELED until proven worth buying. |
| News / IV-surface history | **needed later, defer** | Premium; buy only if ablation shows lift. |
| Earnings/event calendar (historical) | **needed later (Phase C/E)** | Cheap, high context value; procure before options history. |

**No expense is disabled by this build.** Nothing that would destroy capture, historical evidence, or provider access is touched. The one recommended saving (trim non-edge scheduler cadence) is an env change for the owner, documented above.

## Blockers / contradictions register

1. **Historical options data not entitled** (`replay-provider.ts → INACTIVE_MISSING_PROVIDER`). Not a blocker: option outcomes are **MODELED** from underlying path + entry Greeks, honestly flagged. Real historical chains deferred to §13/ablation.
2. **Point-in-time universe, corporate actions, earnings calendar** — required for **Phase C** replay seeding, not Phase A/B. Procurement/verification tracked as Phase-C prerequisites; earnings calendar is a known data gap.
3. **No provider/DB access from the build environment** — Phase A/B/D are built as **pure + OnDb** logic with in-memory-sqlite tests; live seeding (Phase C) runs on Railway boot. This is why the harness (B) precedes the recommender and is validated on synthetic data.
4. **Schema relationship (not a conflict):** `setup_candidates` (live-capture shadow) and `setup_episodes` (rich memory unit) are distinct + additive. A Phase-C adapter derives episodes from candidates and from replay. Both retained.
5. **Modeled ≠ real:** every modeled option label carries `outcome_kind=MODELED_OPTION`; never merged with `EXECUTED_TRADE`/real fills; always disclosed on the card.

## Phase C pre-flight — provider/data audit & scale (verified from integrated code)

Integrated Polygon endpoints (from `lib/polygon-provider.js`): `/v2/aggs/ticker/*` (history),
`/v3/snapshot/options/*` (present-time), `/v2/reference/news`, `/v3/reference/tickers/{sym}`
(single-ticker), stock snapshots. **Entitlement of any endpoint is UNVERIFIED from the build
environment (no live keys) — stated, not guessed.**

| Dataset | Endpoint | Integrated | Phase-C disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Historical OHLCV (adjusted) | `/v2/aggs` (+`adjusted=true`) | yes | **available** — episode seed + underlying labels + split/div-adjusted features |
| Point-in-time universe / active-as-of / delisted | `/v3/reference/tickers?date=` (list) | **no** | caller supplies a survivorship-free symbol list; auto-reconstruction **deferred, flagged** |
| Splits / dividends | `/v3/reference/splits`,`/dividends` | **no** | corporate actions via `adjusted` aggs; symbol-change/delist mapping **deferred** |
| Historical option chains / Greeks / IV history | — | **not entitled** | replay MODELED_OPTION labels **BLOCKED/inactive** — no fabricated Greeks; UNDERLYING labels only |
| Earnings/event history | — | **gap** | event-context null + recorded in `missing`; never fabricated |
| News history | `/v2/reference/news` | present-only | not used in replay |
| Sector / breadth / regime | — | derivable | computed from aggs/index when supplied; else null + `missing` |

**Scale:** ~10⁵–4×10⁵ episodes @3y, 2×10⁵–7×10⁵ @5y, 4×10⁵–1.4×10⁶ @10y; ~3–5 KB/episode →
~1–2 GB @5y, ~3–5 GB @10y (SQLite fine). **No Phase-C schema blocker.** Phase-D retrieval strategy:
pre-filter by indexed comparability columns (`symbol`, `regime_label`, `liquidity_tier`, `session`)
then distance; materialize a compact numeric feature vector for retrieval; ANN (HNSW/IVF) is Phase D/H.

**Blocked & shipped inactive in Phase C:** (a) auto point-in-time universe reconstruction (needs the
reference *list* endpoint + entitlement) — universe is a required caller input; (b) replay
MODELED_OPTION labels (needs historical Greeks — not entitled). Both documented; no data fabricated.

## Phase D — Railway seeding runbook (operator; owner performs)

All new capability is OFF by default. **You** set the env flags and run the curls; I never
enable flags or seed. Token is sent in the `x-scan-token` header only (never a URL). Nothing
below cancels or changes a paid service; env changes are listed for you to approve.

**Env to set on Railway (only when ready to seed):**
`HISTORICAL_REPLAY_ENABLED=1`, `EPISODE_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1`. Kill switch: `EPISODE_SEED_KILL=1`
(pauses any run). `EPISODE_SEED_KILL` unset/`0` to allow. Leave OFF until after step A.

```powershell
$domain = "https://YOUR-RAILWAY-DOMAIN"; $token = "YOUR_SCAN_API_TOKEN"
$H = @{ "x-scan-token" = $token }
# A) ENTITLEMENT CHECK (no seeding; verifies point-in-time universe feasibility; no secrets printed)
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$domain/api/research/entitlement" -Headers $H | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
# → pointInTimeUniverseSufficient true  ⇒ use source:"provider_pit"
#   false ⇒ supply a user-dated file (source:"user_dated_file"), or current-symbols = EXPLORATORY ONLY

# B) SMOKE SEED — DRY RUN first (estimate only; no provider calls, no writes)
$body = @{ symbols=@("AAPL","NVDA","AMD","TSLA","MSFT"); from="2024-01-01"; to="2024-02-01"; source="current"; dryRun=$true } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$domain/api/research/seed" -Headers $H -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
#   → inspect result.estimate (provider calls, episodes, storage). Then set HISTORICAL_REPLAY_ENABLED=1 + EPISODE_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1 on Railway.
# B') SMOKE SEED — REAL (bounded): flip dryRun=$false, add a small budget
$body = @{ symbols=@("AAPL","NVDA","AMD","TSLA","MSFT"); from="2024-01-01"; to="2024-02-01"; source="current"; dryRun=$false; maxSymbols=5; providerCallBudget=20; rateLimitMs=250 } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$domain/api/research/seed" -Headers $H -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6

# C) VALIDATE rows + invariants (read-only)
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$domain/api/research/seed" -Headers $H | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
#   → episodes>0, labels>0, duplicateEpisodeKeys=0, modeledLabelShare=0 (replay = underlying only), sane byLiquidity/byDirection

# D) PILOT universe (broader; still bounded) — repeat B' with a larger symbol list + longer range
# E) FULL 3–5y SEED — provider_pit (or user_dated_file) universe, dryRun=$false, providerCallBudget sized from the estimate.
#    Re-POST to resume (idempotent; checkpoint skips completed symbols). EPISODE_SEED_KILL=1 pauses.

# F) PHASE-D EVALUATION — (added in a later step) runs the harness over the real library and writes analog_eval_reports.
# G) READ THE VERDICT — GET the report; GO only if real_seeded + survivorship-free + beats every baseline OOS + calibrated.
```

Staged gate: **A→B→C** must be clean before **D**; **D→E** before **F**; **F**'s report issues the verdict.
A survivorship-biased/undated universe returns `verdictEligibility: EXPLORATORY ONLY` and can never GO.

## Resume point
- **Now building: Phase A.** Files: `lib/research/episode/*`, additive tables `setup_episodes` + `episode_labels`, tests `tests/analog-episode-*.test.mjs`. Default OFF / not wired into the live cycle. Gate: leakage + label-math tests green + full suite/tsc/build green.
