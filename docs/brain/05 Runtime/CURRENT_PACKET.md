# Current Task Packet

Task ID: high-asymmetry-paper-lane-deploy-disabled

## Active position

- Branch: `main`
- Previous deployed commit: `6c15d3b` (docs `c9c5851` on top)
- This work: the automatic paper-trading lane, built and **DISABLED**
- Verified locally: `npm test` 2799/2799 twice, `tsc --noEmit` clean,
  `npm run build` clean, `git diff --check` clean, `graphify update .` run

## Completed — High-Asymmetry paper lane

| Feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Separate lane `HIGH_ASYMMETRY_PAPER` (own tables) | BUILT_DISABLED |
| Automatic entry on EARLY_ASYMMETRY / CONFIRMING / HIGH_ASYMMETRY | BUILT_DISABLED |
| Deterministic sizing (FIXED_CONTRACT + FIXED_RISK) | BUILT_DISABLED |
| Versioned management and exits (`HIGH_ASYMMETRY_PAPER_V1`) | BUILT_DISABLED |
| Scheduler job `asymmetryPaper` (60s, clamped) | BUILT_DISABLED |
| Deterministic Quant cohorts, holdout, associations, proposals | BUILT_DISABLED |
| Daily paper report in the EOD review | BUILT_DISABLED |
| Report delivery via recap webhook | BLOCKED_CONFIG (recap unset, owner decision) |
| AI budget: 1 call/session, cached, daily+monthly limits | BUILT_DISABLED |
| Private diagnostics extended | BUILT_DISABLED |
| Owner-private send transport (defect fix) | BUILT — active as soon as a case transitions |
| Executed against a live candidate | MISSING — the radar has still never captured one |
| Subscriber SEND authority | MISSING (permanently, by design) |

## Feature flags

- `HIGH_ASYMMETRY_CAPTURE_ENABLED` — **enabled** (unchanged)
- `HIGH_ASYMMETRY_PRIVATE_ENABLED` — **enabled** (unchanged)
- `HIGH_ASYMMETRY_PRIVATE_WEBHOOK` — **configured** (unchanged, never displayed)
- `HIGH_ASYMMETRY_PAPER_ENABLED` — **NOT SET. Requires owner approval.**

I changed no Railway variable. The paper lane ships inert.

## The defect this work uncovered

`notifyPrivateAsymmetry` takes an OPTIONAL injected `send` and the scheduler
never injected one, so every owner-private notification returned
`NOT_CONFIGURED` while diagnostics reported `enabled: true,
webhookConfigured: true`. **No private message could have been delivered on
Friday.** Fixed and covered by `tests/high-asymmetry-private-send.test.mjs`.

This is the same class of failure the acceptance gate exists to catch — a
module that exists, type-checks, and is fully unit-tested but is not reachable
from anything that runs. The unit tests all injected a sender, so none of them
could see it.

## What remains unproven

- **The radar has never executed against a live candidate. Zero cases exist, so
  zero paper positions exist and none of the five paper tables has been created
  on the production volume.**
- Everything in the lane is proven by unit test and by source-level graph
  acceptance. None of it has run against a real quote.
- The OCC-matching question is still open and now matters twice: if
  `fetchOptionChain` returns a contract whose `optionSymbol` does not match the
  stored OCC, both `markRejections` AND the paper lane's entry will fill with
  NO_QUOTE / WRONG_OCC. Safe, but zero positions and zero graded outcomes.
- The private send path has never actually posted a message.

## Exact next bounded checkpoint

1. Deploy with `HIGH_ASYMMETRY_PAPER_ENABLED` unset. Verify:
   - `/api/research/asymmetry/live` returns `paperTrading.enabled: false`
   - the `asymmetryPaper` job is registered and reports the flag reason
   - Discord byte-identical to baseline; scanner unaffected
2. Observe the first live session with the paper lane still DISABLED.
3. Only then request approval for `HIGH_ASYMMETRY_PAPER_ENABLED=1`.

Watch, in order, during the first live session:
1. `activeCases` non-zero — the live call site fires.
2. `markRejections` — NO_QUOTE means the OCC does not match; PROVIDER_ERROR
   means an outage.
3. `privateNotification.notifiedCount` — the first message the fix makes
   possible.
4. After 20:15 ET, the EOD review persists with the paper section present and
   `deliveryStatus: BLOCKED_CONFIG`.

## Stop conditions

- do not set any Railway variable without explicit owner approval
- do not enable `HIGH_ASYMMETRY_PAPER_ENABLED` as part of verification
- do not send any Discord test message
- do not touch trading gates, ranking, or subscriber delivery
- do not stage Obsidian line-ending noise, `graph.json`, `workspace.json`,
  `graphify-out/`, or unrelated files
- do not use `git add .`, `git reset`, or force-push
- do not describe the paper lane as active: it is built and disabled, and has
  never opened a position
